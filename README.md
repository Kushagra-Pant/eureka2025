# Small World Wonders

Small World Wonders was a project created by Kushagra Pant, Thomas Duong, Ali, and Vasil Petrov for the 2025 EurekaHACKS hackathon at Abbey Park High School. As part of the hackathon's "outdoors" theme this year, our game challenges players to visit real-world landmarks nearby based on their current location, snap a photo, and earn points based on how far they journeyed. 

## Technologies
- Leaflet for interactive maps
- Overpass for landmarks querying
- Custom pixel-difference image comparison algorithm
